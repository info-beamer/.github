# The digital signage solution for the Raspberry Pi

info-beamer allows you to play [videos, images](https://info-beamer.com/pkg/386) and
[web content](https://info-beamer.com/pkg/41861) on your Pi. It also provides advanced
features like support for [video walls](https://info-beamer.com/use-cases/raspberry-pi-video-wall).

It supports all Pi models going back all the way to
the first Pi 1. Unlike other solution all content playing on the
device is controlled by code. We provide the source code
for almost all such packages so you can see how they work
and extend them if necessary.

info-beamer's custom minimal operating system is only 60MB in size so you can literally
[install it on a blank SD card in 10 seconds](https://info-beamer.com/doc/installing-hosted).
