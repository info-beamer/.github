# The digital signage solution for the Raspberry Pi

info-beamer allows you to play video, image and web content on your Pi. It supports all Pi models going back all the way to
the first Pi 1. Unlike other solution all content playing on the device is controlled by code. We provide the source code
for almost all such packages so you can see how they work and extend them if necessary.
